Dollar Store Makeup Mirrors and How They Heal the SoulÂ 
By Clayton Dunavant

Candle fire and cheap  
precious-stones. Three Goodwill witches 
at the dawn of the age  

of Aquarius. Clad in grandpa sweaters 
rather than robes. 
Ringed hands turned metal claws trace 
symbols towards the heavens. 

The Great Conjunction 
of Jupiter and Saturn 
birth a new star-planet 
just for one night. 

Pink makeup portals 
collect its silver starlight. 
Good vibes 

for the taking. 
To be opened  
in some dark time.
