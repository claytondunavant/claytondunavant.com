I wrote this poem for my intro to creative writing class.

```
yell.
By Clayton Dunavant

and. 
	and. 
		and. 
And when I yell, 
I feel realized. 
Like I am alive 

Filled in the lines 
brown in the hair 
blue red in the eyes 
and dark trails down from them 

And when I stutter like 
like. 
	like. 
		like. 
The prophet Moses 
I feel clear. 

Too often 
I am hidden 
behind others 
and obligations towards life 

So when I yell, 
you can see me 
selfishly screaming to the void. 
```
